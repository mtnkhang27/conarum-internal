## 3. Use Case 1 Configuration — Exact Score

### Key Settings

| Setting | Default | Range | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| Enable | ✅ On | — | Toggle entire UC1 |
| Max Bets per Match | 3 | 1–10 | How many scores a user can guess |
| Base Price (VND) | 50,000 | — | Cost per bet |
| Base Reward (VND) | 200,000 | — | Payout for correct score |
| Allow Duplicate Bets | ✅ Yes | — | Same score multiple times |
| Duplicate Multiplier | 2x | 1–10x | Reward multiplier for duplicates |
| Bonus Multiplier | 1.5x | 1–5x | Extra multiplier for special matches |
| Platform Fee | 5% | 0–20% | Deducted from winnings |
| Lock Before Match | 30 min | 0–120 min | Stop bets X min before kickoff |
| Payout Delay | 24h | 0–72h | Wait before paying out (for corrections) |

### Reward Formula

```
Payout = BaseReward × DupMultiplier × BonusMultiplier × (1 − Fee/100)
```

**Example:** 2 bets on same score (2-1), correct, finals match:
```
= 200,000 × 2 × 1.5 × (1 − 0.05) = 570,000 VND
```

## 4. Use Case 2 Configuration — Match Outcome ⭐

### Point System

| Wrong | 0 pts | ✅ (-5 to +5) |

### Match Weights

> [!IMPORTANT]

## 8. Sandbox User Provisioning

Use **Admin -> Sandbox Users** when you need to pre-create a sandbox account before the user signs in for the first time.

### Provisioning Behavior

- Every provisioned account is added to role collection `CNMA_CONARUM_INTERNAL_USER`.
- Every provisioned account is mirrored into the app with role `PredictionUser`.
- Emails listed in the admin textarea also receive role collection `CNMA_CONARUM_INTERNAL_ADMIN`.
- Admin emails are mirrored into the app with role `PredictionAdmin` in addition to `PredictionUser`.
- If an initial password is entered in the form, it is sent only for newly created users.
- If the form password is empty, the backend falls back to env var `IDP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`.
- Existing users keep their current password. The result card shows whether a password was actually applied.

### Required Backend Configuration

Provisioning needs these backend environment variables:

- `IDP_SCIM_BASE_URL`
- `IDP_SCIM_BASIC_USERNAME`
- `IDP_SCIM_BASIC_PASSWORD`
- `IDP_DEFAULT_USER_GROUP` (optional, default: `CNMA_CONARUM_INTERNAL_USER`)
- `IDP_ADMIN_GROUP` (optional, default: `CNMA_CONARUM_INTERNAL_ADMIN`)
- `IDP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` (optional fallback if the admin UI leaves the password blank)

### Recommended Admin Test Flow

1. Open **Admin -> Sandbox Users**.
2. Enter one or more user emails in the user list.
3. Optionally enter matching emails in the admin list if they need admin access.
4. Optionally set an initial password for this provisioning run.
5. Click **Provision Users to Sandbox**.
6. Confirm the result card shows `created` or `existing`, the assigned groups, the assigned app roles, whether the password was applied, and the SCIM user ID.
7. Ask the created user to sign in through the sandbox route and verify the account lands in the expected player or admin experience.

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| User can't submit prediction | Match already kicked off | Auto-lock working correctly. No action needed. |
| Leaderboard not updating | Calculation delay active | Wait for delay period (default 2h). Or manually trigger recalculation. |
| Wrong score entered | Human error | Edit match, correct score. System auto-recalculates. |
| Duplicate prediction slip entries | User submitted multiple times | System deduplicates. Check DB for unique constraint. |
| UC3 still "Open" during tournament | Admin forgot to lock | Go to UC3 Config → Change status to "Locked". |
| Prize split calculation wrong | Max winners exceeded | Check `maxWinnersForSplit` setting. |
| Sandbox provisioning fails immediately | Missing SCIM env vars on backend | Set `IDP_SCIM_BASE_URL`, `IDP_SCIM_BASIC_USERNAME`, and `IDP_SCIM_BASIC_PASSWORD`, then restart or restage the backend |
| User was created but cannot use the expected password | Account already existed before provisioning | Existing users keep their password. Reset it outside the app or provision a fresh test account |
